Glad to hear it! What's on your mind today?






Dito por si:
do you know commander
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with Commander! It's a popular multiplayer format in Magic: The Gathering where each player builds a 100-card deck, led by a legendary creature or planeswalker known as the commander. The deck can only include cards that match the color identity of the commander, and you can't have more than one copy of any card except basic lands.

Are you playing Commander, or working on something related to it in your project?

i have a sugestion from one of the players to add objectives to the league, but i already had objectives and punishments in a previous league and i has not a fan of the way it was done.

I see! If objectives didn't work well before, maybe we could find a fresh approach. What kind of issues did you have with the way objectives and punishments were handled in the past? That could help us figure out a better way to incorporate or tweak them.






Dito por si:
players were to focused on the objectives and some people(who didn't play) tried to make decks arround the objectives to be the most effective
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
It sounds like the objectives took away from the spirit of the games by making players overly focused on specific tasks rather than just enjoying the games organically. Plus, if people who didn’t play were designing decks solely to exploit those objectives, it could have skewed the competition.

One way to address this could be to design more open-ended, fun, or thematic objectives that encourage creativity but don’t dictate gameplay too strictly. You could also make objectives optional or give them as bonus challenges that don’t interfere too much with the main points system.

What do you think about making objectives more casual or offering them as side goals that don’t dominate the league's focus?






Dito por si:
my idea is, 2 kinds of objectives, a big objective and punishment per round and 2 smaller objectives and punishments per week, this beeing drawn randomly each round and week
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
That sounds like a great way to mix things up while keeping the objectives from being too rigid or repetitive! Randomizing the objectives each round and week adds a layer of unpredictability, which could make the games more dynamic and fun without players being able to prepare decks solely focused on the objectives.

Would you like help brainstorming possible objectives and punishments, or are you thinking about how to implement the random drawing process?






Dito por si:
help me with the brainstorming, as the drawn i will probably have the players take them from a "hat"
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
I love the idea of drawing from a "hat" for that extra bit of excitement! Here are some ideas for both the big objectives/punishments (per round) and smaller ones (per week):

Big Objectives (Round-based)
Ultimate Sacrifice: Control a legendary creature, then sacrifice it.
Punishment: Start your next game with 2 fewer cards in hand.

Artifact Master: Have at least 5 different artifact types on the battlefield at once.
Punishment: Lose 2 life for each artifact on the battlefield.

Color Mastery: Cast a spell from each color (W, U, B, R, G) during a game.
Punishment: Skip your first untap step in the next game.

Mana Overload: Produce 10 or more mana in a single turn.
Punishment: Start the next game with one fewer land.

Endgame Presence: Survive until your third turn in a 1v1 situation (1 opponent left).
Punishment: Next game, your opponents get to draw an extra card if you’re still alive on turn 5.

Big Punishments (Round-based)
Deck Restriction: Play your next game without using any creatures with a mana cost of 4 or greater.

Life Drain: Start your next game at 30 life instead of 40.

Commander’s Curse: Your commander costs 2 extra mana for the first cast in the next game.

Small Objectives (Week-based)
Draw Power: Draw 3 or more cards in a single turn.
Punishment: Skip your draw step on your first turn next game.

Sneaky Win: Win a game without casting your commander.
Punishment: Start your next game with your commander in the graveyard.

Go Wide: Have 10 or more creatures on the battlefield at once.
Punishment: Sacrifice a creature at the start of your next game.

Casting Spree: Cast 5 spells in a single turn.
Punishment: Exile a card from your hand at the start of your next game.

Commander Damage: Deal 12 or more commander damage to a single player in one game.
Punishment: Pay 1 life each time your commander attacks in your next game.

Small Punishments (Week-based)
Land Tax: Start your next game with one fewer land in hand.

Draw Drought: Skip your draw step on turn 2 of your next game.

Mana Block: You can’t tap for more than 5 mana per turn in your next game until turn 6.

These objectives keep the focus on fun, encourage a mix of strategies, and the punishments are impactful without being too harsh. How do you feel about this mix? We can adjust them based on what you want your players to experience.

Dito por si:
based on this, since i have a 12pts per week, how should i change the point system? keep in mind that i maintain the points per position
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
To integrate the objectives and penalties into your existing point system while maintaining the maximum of 12 points per week, you can consider the following adjustments:

Revised Point System for Each Week
Points Based on Position: Keep the existing point structure:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Weekly Total from Games
The maximum points from games will still total 10 points (4 + 3 + 2 + 1).
Incorporating Objectives
Since you have 2 smaller objectives per week, you can assign each objective a value that adds to the weekly total. Here’s a suggestion:
+2 Points for Each Objective Completed: This encourages players to pursue objectives while keeping the total manageable.
Weekly Points Breakdown Example
Maximum Points from Games: 10 points
Points from Objectives: 4 points (2 objectives × +2 points each)
Total Weekly Points Calculation
Total Weekly Points:
10 points (from games) + 4 points (from objectives) = 14 points total (but you’ll cap this at 12 points)
To maintain the weekly cap of 12 points, you could either:

Limit the points from objectives: Instead of +2, consider making them worth +1 point each.

Maximum Points from Objectives: 2 points (1 point for each objective)
This gives a total of 12 points per week:
10 points (from games) + 2 points (from objectives).
Capping the total: After calculating total points, you can still cap the weekly total at 12 points. So if a player achieves 14 points (10 from games and 4 from objectives), only 12 points would count for that week.

Final Suggestion
Maintain Existing Game Points:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Add Weekly Objectives:
Each objective completed earns +1 point.
Total weekly points capped at 12.
This way, you preserve the competitive nature of the league while incorporating the objectives effectively. Let me know what you think or if you’d like to adjust anything further!






Dito por si:
i forgot about the 1 point per round and 3 points per new player introduced to the league
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
No problem! Let’s incorporate those points into the overall weekly point system while maintaining the cap of 12 points per week. Here’s how you can structure it:

Updated Weekly Points Breakdown
Points Based on Position (from games):

1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from Position: 10 points
Points for New Players:

3 points for introducing a new player to the league.
Points per Round:

1 point for participating in the round.
Weekly Objectives:

Each completed objective earns +1 point.
Assuming you have 2 objectives per week, that’s a maximum of 2 points from objectives.
Total Weekly Points Calculation
Combining all these elements, you can outline the maximum points a player can earn in a week as follows:

From Games (Positions): 10 points
From New Players: 3 points (if they introduce a new player)
From Rounds: 1 point (for participating in the round)
From Objectives: 2 points (if both objectives are completed)
Total Potential Points:
Without New Players:
10 (from games) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 13 points
With New Player:
10 (from games) + 3 (for new player) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 16 points
Capping Weekly Points:
Since you want to maintain a cap of 12 points per week, you can implement a rule like this:

Total Weekly Points will be capped at 12: If a player exceeds 12 points based on their performance, only 12 points will count toward their total.
Final Breakdown:
Game Points: Up to 10 points based on position.
Points for New Players: Up to 3 points for introducing new players.
Participation Point: 1 point per round.
Objectives Points: Up to 2 points for objectives.
Total: Max 12 points per week (capped).

This structure maintains competitive balance while encouraging players to engage with the league through objectives, new player introductions, and participation. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or have additional ideas!

Dito pelo ChatGPT:

Memória atualizada
Great! If you're open to adjusting the point system without a strict cap, you can create a more dynamic and rewarding system. Here’s a suggestion that allows for potentially higher scores based on performance while still keeping it competitive:

Flexible Weekly Points Breakdown
Points Based on Position (from games):

1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from Position: 10 points
Points for New Players:

3 points for introducing a new player to the league.
Points per Round:

1 point for participating in the round.
Weekly Objectives:

Each completed objective earns +1 point.
Assuming you have 2 objectives per week, that’s a maximum of 2 points from objectives.
Total Potential Points Without a Cap:
From Games (Positions): 10 points
From New Players: 3 points (if they introduce a new player)
From Rounds: 1 point (for participating in the round)
From Objectives: 2 points (if both objectives are completed)
Potential Total:
Without New Players:
10 (from games) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 13 points
With New Player:
10 (from games) + 3 (for new player) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 16 points
Additional Suggestions for Scaling Points:
Rewarding Consistency: You could consider awarding bonus points for consistent high placements over multiple games or rounds. For example:
Bonus for 1st Place: +1 point for each additional game won after the first in a week.
Dynamic Objectives: Introduce a variety of objectives each week that may provide different point values based on their difficulty or impact. For instance:
More challenging objectives could award +2 points instead of +1, while simpler ones remain at +1.
Encouraging Engagement:
Bonus for New Players: You could also introduce a cumulative bonus for multiple new players brought in throughout the league:
+1 additional point for every second new player introduced beyond the first.
Final Consideration:
By allowing the potential total to exceed 12 points, you create a system that encourages players to engage fully—whether through winning games, completing objectives, or bringing new players into the league. This approach can enhance competition and player satisfaction.

Let me know if you like this direction or if you want to explore more options!

yeah but the bring new players stuff i dont know, i have players who want to exploit it. how should i proceed?
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
To prevent exploitation of the system regarding bringing new players, you can consider a few strategies that maintain fairness and encourage genuine engagement without allowing players to game the system:

1. Set Clear Limits
Limit Points to One per Week: You could award points for introducing new players, but limit it to one instance of points per week. For example, a player can earn 3 points for introducing a new player, but they cannot earn additional points for introducing multiple new players in the same week.
Cumulative Rewards Over Time: Instead of awarding points for each new player, consider giving cumulative rewards at the end of the league. For instance:
At the end of the league: Award 5 points for each new player introduced, but this can only be claimed once per new player introduced throughout the league.
2. Implement Verification
Introduce Verification Process: Require that any new player introduced must participate in at least one game to qualify for the points. This ensures that the new player is genuinely engaging with the league, not just a placeholder.
3. Encourage Genuine Engagement
Player Sponsorship: Consider implementing a system where existing players can sponsor new players. Only the sponsors can earn points for introducing a new player, which can create a sense of accountability.
Host Events for New Players: Encourage current players to host events or demo sessions for potential new players. Points could be awarded for hosting, rather than just for the act of introducing someone.
4. Track Participation
Track New Player Engagement: Have a system in place to track how often new players participate. If a player introduces a new player who does not return or engage, the points could be revoked.
5. Reward Active Contributions
Points for Engagement Beyond Introduction: Instead of just rewarding points for bringing in new players, you could also reward points for active participation in games, helping them learn, or providing support. For example, you could award additional points for:
Mentoring a new player during their first few games.
Example System:
3 Points for introducing a new player, but:
The new player must participate in at least one game to qualify.
Points can only be earned once per player.
At the end of the league, award additional points for the total number of new players introduced (e.g., 5 points for each new player who participated in at least one game).
By incorporating these measures, you can encourage players to bring in new participants while minimizing the risk of exploitation. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any of these ideas or if you have other concerns!






Dito por si:
i liked the tracked Participation part
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
Great! Tracking new player participation can help ensure that the system remains fair and encourages genuine engagement. Here’s how you could implement it effectively:

Tracking New Player Participation
New Player Registration:

Create a Registration Process: Have a simple form or log where new players can register when they join the league. This could include their name, contact info, and the name of the player who introduced them.
Participation Log:

Track Games Played: Maintain a log of games played by new players, including which games they participated in and their outcomes. This could be done manually or through a league management tool.
Set a Minimum Participation Requirement: To qualify for the points awarded for introducing new players, the new player must participate in at least one game during the league.
Points Awarding System:

Award Points: After the new player has participated, the introducing player earns the 3 points for that new player.
End-of-League Bonus: Consider a review process at the end of the league where additional points are awarded for each new player who played multiple games, fostering ongoing participation.
Verification Process:

Check Participation: Before awarding points, verify that the new player has participated in at least one game. If they don’t, no points are awarded to the introducing player.
Feedback from New Players: Optionally, you could gather feedback from new players about their experience, which can help assess the quality of the engagement.
Public Leaderboard:

Display Participation Stats: Create a public leaderboard that shows how many games new players have played and highlights the players who introduced them. This can foster a sense of community and healthy competition.
Example System Implementation:
New Player Introduced: Player A introduces Player B.
Player B must play at least one game: If Player B plays at least one game, Player A earns 3 points.
At the end of the league: If Player B plays more than 3 games, Player A could earn additional bonus points (e.g., 2 extra points for every game beyond the first).
By using a tracking system, you not only mitigate the risk of exploitation but also create a more welcoming environment for new players. This can encourage them to return and participate actively, enriching the overall league experience.

Let me know if you need help with the logistics of implementing this or if you have any other ideas!

That sounds like a solid approach! Here’s how you could structure this system:

Point System for Introducing New Players
Initial Points for Introduction:

1 Point: When Player A introduces new Player B and Player B participates in at least one game, Player A receives 1 point.
Retention Points:

2 Points: At the end of the league, if Player B has continued participating throughout, Player A earns the remaining 2 points.
Implementation Steps
Tracking Participation:

Maintain a log of all new players and their participation in games.
Regularly update this log to reflect Player B’s involvement in the league.
Point Awarding Process:

After the first game Player B plays, award Player A 1 point for the introduction.
At the end of the league, review Player B's overall participation:
If Player B has played a minimum number of games (e.g., 3 games), award Player A an additional 2 points.
Communication:

Keep players informed about how the point system works, emphasizing the importance of new player retention and participation.
Benefits of This System
Encourages Genuine Introductions: Players will be more motivated to bring in new players they believe will enjoy the game and continue participating.
Fosters Community: This approach can create a supportive environment where existing players help newcomers get acclimated to the league.
Incentivizes Long-term Engagement: By rewarding ongoing participation, you help create a stable player base, making the league more enjoyable for everyone.
