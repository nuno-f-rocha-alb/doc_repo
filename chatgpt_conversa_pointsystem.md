Glad to hear it! What's on your mind today?






Dito por si:
do you know commander
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Yes, I'm familiar with Commander! It's a popular multiplayer format in Magic: The Gathering where each player builds a 100-card deck, led by a legendary creature or planeswalker known as the commander. The deck can only include cards that match the color identity of the commander, and you can't have more than one copy of any card except basic lands.

Are you playing Commander, or working on something related to it in your project?

i have a sugestion from one of the players to add objectives to the league, but i already had objectives and punishments in a previous league and i has not a fan of the way it was done.

I see! If objectives didn't work well before, maybe we could find a fresh approach. What kind of issues did you have with the way objectives and punishments were handled in the past? That could help us figure out a better way to incorporate or tweak them.






Dito por si:
players were to focused on the objectives and some people(who didn't play) tried to make decks arround the objectives to be the most effective
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
It sounds like the objectives took away from the spirit of the games by making players overly focused on specific tasks rather than just enjoying the games organically. Plus, if people who didn’t play were designing decks solely to exploit those objectives, it could have skewed the competition.

One way to address this could be to design more open-ended, fun, or thematic objectives that encourage creativity but don’t dictate gameplay too strictly. You could also make objectives optional or give them as bonus challenges that don’t interfere too much with the main points system.

What do you think about making objectives more casual or offering them as side goals that don’t dominate the league's focus?






Dito por si:
my idea is, 2 kinds of objectives, a big objective and punishment per round and 2 smaller objectives and punishments per week, this beeing drawn randomly each round and week
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
That sounds like a great way to mix things up while keeping the objectives from being too rigid or repetitive! Randomizing the objectives each round and week adds a layer of unpredictability, which could make the games more dynamic and fun without players being able to prepare decks solely focused on the objectives.

Would you like help brainstorming possible objectives and punishments, or are you thinking about how to implement the random drawing process?






Dito por si:
help me with the brainstorming, as the drawn i will probably have the players take them from a "hat"
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
I love the idea of drawing from a "hat" for that extra bit of excitement! Here are some ideas for both the big objectives/punishments (per round) and smaller ones (per week):

Big Objectives (Round-based)
Ultimate Sacrifice: Control a legendary creature, then sacrifice it.
Punishment: Start your next game with 2 fewer cards in hand.

Artifact Master: Have at least 5 different artifact types on the battlefield at once.
Punishment: Lose 2 life for each artifact on the battlefield.

Color Mastery: Cast a spell from each color (W, U, B, R, G) during a game.
Punishment: Skip your first untap step in the next game.

Mana Overload: Produce 10 or more mana in a single turn.
Punishment: Start the next game with one fewer land.

Endgame Presence: Survive until your third turn in a 1v1 situation (1 opponent left).
Punishment: Next game, your opponents get to draw an extra card if you’re still alive on turn 5.

Big Punishments (Round-based)
Deck Restriction: Play your next game without using any creatures with a mana cost of 4 or greater.

Life Drain: Start your next game at 30 life instead of 40.

Commander’s Curse: Your commander costs 2 extra mana for the first cast in the next game.

Small Objectives (Week-based)
Draw Power: Draw 3 or more cards in a single turn.
Punishment: Skip your draw step on your first turn next game.

Sneaky Win: Win a game without casting your commander.
Punishment: Start your next game with your commander in the graveyard.

Go Wide: Have 10 or more creatures on the battlefield at once.
Punishment: Sacrifice a creature at the start of your next game.

Casting Spree: Cast 5 spells in a single turn.
Punishment: Exile a card from your hand at the start of your next game.

Commander Damage: Deal 12 or more commander damage to a single player in one game.
Punishment: Pay 1 life each time your commander attacks in your next game.

Small Punishments (Week-based)
Land Tax: Start your next game with one fewer land in hand.

Draw Drought: Skip your draw step on turn 2 of your next game.

Mana Block: You can’t tap for more than 5 mana per turn in your next game until turn 6.

These objectives keep the focus on fun, encourage a mix of strategies, and the punishments are impactful without being too harsh. How do you feel about this mix? We can adjust them based on what you want your players to experience.

Dito por si:
based on this, since i have a 12pts per week, how should i change the point system? keep in mind that i maintain the points per position
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
To integrate the objectives and penalties into your existing point system while maintaining the maximum of 12 points per week, you can consider the following adjustments:

Revised Point System for Each Week
Points Based on Position: Keep the existing point structure:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Weekly Total from Games
The maximum points from games will still total 10 points (4 + 3 + 2 + 1).
Incorporating Objectives
Since you have 2 smaller objectives per week, you can assign each objective a value that adds to the weekly total. Here’s a suggestion:
+2 Points for Each Objective Completed: This encourages players to pursue objectives while keeping the total manageable.
Weekly Points Breakdown Example
Maximum Points from Games: 10 points
Points from Objectives: 4 points (2 objectives × +2 points each)
Total Weekly Points Calculation
Total Weekly Points:
10 points (from games) + 4 points (from objectives) = 14 points total (but you’ll cap this at 12 points)
To maintain the weekly cap of 12 points, you could either:

Limit the points from objectives: Instead of +2, consider making them worth +1 point each.

Maximum Points from Objectives: 2 points (1 point for each objective)
This gives a total of 12 points per week:
10 points (from games) + 2 points (from objectives).
Capping the total: After calculating total points, you can still cap the weekly total at 12 points. So if a player achieves 14 points (10 from games and 4 from objectives), only 12 points would count for that week.

Final Suggestion
Maintain Existing Game Points:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Add Weekly Objectives:
Each objective completed earns +1 point.
Total weekly points capped at 12.
This way, you preserve the competitive nature of the league while incorporating the objectives effectively. Let me know what you think or if you’d like to adjust anything further!






Dito por si:
i forgot about the 1 point per round and 3 points per new player introduced to the league
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
No problem! Let’s incorporate those points into the overall weekly point system while maintaining the cap of 12 points per week. Here’s how you can structure it:

Updated Weekly Points Breakdown
Points Based on Position (from games):

1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from Position: 10 points
Points for New Players:

3 points for introducing a new player to the league.
Points per Round:

1 point for participating in the round.
Weekly Objectives:

Each completed objective earns +1 point.
Assuming you have 2 objectives per week, that’s a maximum of 2 points from objectives.
Total Weekly Points Calculation
Combining all these elements, you can outline the maximum points a player can earn in a week as follows:

From Games (Positions): 10 points
From New Players: 3 points (if they introduce a new player)
From Rounds: 1 point (for participating in the round)
From Objectives: 2 points (if both objectives are completed)
Total Potential Points:
Without New Players:
10 (from games) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 13 points
With New Player:
10 (from games) + 3 (for new player) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 16 points
Capping Weekly Points:
Since you want to maintain a cap of 12 points per week, you can implement a rule like this:

Total Weekly Points will be capped at 12: If a player exceeds 12 points based on their performance, only 12 points will count toward their total.
Final Breakdown:
Game Points: Up to 10 points based on position.
Points for New Players: Up to 3 points for introducing new players.
Participation Point: 1 point per round.
Objectives Points: Up to 2 points for objectives.
Total: Max 12 points per week (capped).

This structure maintains competitive balance while encouraging players to engage with the league through objectives, new player introductions, and participation. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or have additional ideas!

Dito pelo ChatGPT:

Memória atualizada
Great! If you're open to adjusting the point system without a strict cap, you can create a more dynamic and rewarding system. Here’s a suggestion that allows for potentially higher scores based on performance while still keeping it competitive:

Flexible Weekly Points Breakdown
Points Based on Position (from games):

1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from Position: 10 points
Points for New Players:

3 points for introducing a new player to the league.
Points per Round:

1 point for participating in the round.
Weekly Objectives:

Each completed objective earns +1 point.
Assuming you have 2 objectives per week, that’s a maximum of 2 points from objectives.
Total Potential Points Without a Cap:
From Games (Positions): 10 points
From New Players: 3 points (if they introduce a new player)
From Rounds: 1 point (for participating in the round)
From Objectives: 2 points (if both objectives are completed)
Potential Total:
Without New Players:
10 (from games) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 13 points
With New Player:
10 (from games) + 3 (for new player) + 1 (for round) + 2 (from objectives) = 16 points
Additional Suggestions for Scaling Points:
Rewarding Consistency: You could consider awarding bonus points for consistent high placements over multiple games or rounds. For example:
Bonus for 1st Place: +1 point for each additional game won after the first in a week.
Dynamic Objectives: Introduce a variety of objectives each week that may provide different point values based on their difficulty or impact. For instance:
More challenging objectives could award +2 points instead of +1, while simpler ones remain at +1.
Encouraging Engagement:
Bonus for New Players: You could also introduce a cumulative bonus for multiple new players brought in throughout the league:
+1 additional point for every second new player introduced beyond the first.
Final Consideration:
By allowing the potential total to exceed 12 points, you create a system that encourages players to engage fully—whether through winning games, completing objectives, or bringing new players into the league. This approach can enhance competition and player satisfaction.

Let me know if you like this direction or if you want to explore more options!

yeah but the bring new players stuff i dont know, i have players who want to exploit it. how should i proceed?
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
To prevent exploitation of the system regarding bringing new players, you can consider a few strategies that maintain fairness and encourage genuine engagement without allowing players to game the system:

1. Set Clear Limits
Limit Points to One per Week: You could award points for introducing new players, but limit it to one instance of points per week. For example, a player can earn 3 points for introducing a new player, but they cannot earn additional points for introducing multiple new players in the same week.
Cumulative Rewards Over Time: Instead of awarding points for each new player, consider giving cumulative rewards at the end of the league. For instance:
At the end of the league: Award 5 points for each new player introduced, but this can only be claimed once per new player introduced throughout the league.
2. Implement Verification
Introduce Verification Process: Require that any new player introduced must participate in at least one game to qualify for the points. This ensures that the new player is genuinely engaging with the league, not just a placeholder.
3. Encourage Genuine Engagement
Player Sponsorship: Consider implementing a system where existing players can sponsor new players. Only the sponsors can earn points for introducing a new player, which can create a sense of accountability.
Host Events for New Players: Encourage current players to host events or demo sessions for potential new players. Points could be awarded for hosting, rather than just for the act of introducing someone.
4. Track Participation
Track New Player Engagement: Have a system in place to track how often new players participate. If a player introduces a new player who does not return or engage, the points could be revoked.
5. Reward Active Contributions
Points for Engagement Beyond Introduction: Instead of just rewarding points for bringing in new players, you could also reward points for active participation in games, helping them learn, or providing support. For example, you could award additional points for:
Mentoring a new player during their first few games.
Example System:
3 Points for introducing a new player, but:
The new player must participate in at least one game to qualify.
Points can only be earned once per player.
At the end of the league, award additional points for the total number of new players introduced (e.g., 5 points for each new player who participated in at least one game).
By incorporating these measures, you can encourage players to bring in new participants while minimizing the risk of exploitation. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any of these ideas or if you have other concerns!






Dito por si:
i liked the tracked Participation part
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Memória atualizada
Great! Tracking new player participation can help ensure that the system remains fair and encourages genuine engagement. Here’s how you could implement it effectively:

Tracking New Player Participation
New Player Registration:

Create a Registration Process: Have a simple form or log where new players can register when they join the league. This could include their name, contact info, and the name of the player who introduced them.
Participation Log:

Track Games Played: Maintain a log of games played by new players, including which games they participated in and their outcomes. This could be done manually or through a league management tool.
Set a Minimum Participation Requirement: To qualify for the points awarded for introducing new players, the new player must participate in at least one game during the league.
Points Awarding System:

Award Points: After the new player has participated, the introducing player earns the 3 points for that new player.
End-of-League Bonus: Consider a review process at the end of the league where additional points are awarded for each new player who played multiple games, fostering ongoing participation.
Verification Process:

Check Participation: Before awarding points, verify that the new player has participated in at least one game. If they don’t, no points are awarded to the introducing player.
Feedback from New Players: Optionally, you could gather feedback from new players about their experience, which can help assess the quality of the engagement.
Public Leaderboard:

Display Participation Stats: Create a public leaderboard that shows how many games new players have played and highlights the players who introduced them. This can foster a sense of community and healthy competition.
Example System Implementation:
New Player Introduced: Player A introduces Player B.
Player B must play at least one game: If Player B plays at least one game, Player A earns 3 points.
At the end of the league: If Player B plays more than 3 games, Player A could earn additional bonus points (e.g., 2 extra points for every game beyond the first).
By using a tracking system, you not only mitigate the risk of exploitation but also create a more welcoming environment for new players. This can encourage them to return and participate actively, enriching the overall league experience.

Let me know if you need help with the logistics of implementing this or if you have any other ideas!

That sounds like a solid approach! Here’s how you could structure this system:

Point System for Introducing New Players
Initial Points for Introduction:

1 Point: When Player A introduces new Player B and Player B participates in at least one game, Player A receives 1 point.
Retention Points:

2 Points: At the end of the league, if Player B has continued participating throughout, Player A earns the remaining 2 points.
Implementation Steps
Tracking Participation:

Maintain a log of all new players and their participation in games.
Regularly update this log to reflect Player B’s involvement in the league.
Point Awarding Process:

After the first game Player B plays, award Player A 1 point for the introduction.
At the end of the league, review Player B's overall participation:
If Player B has played a minimum number of games (e.g., 3 games), award Player A an additional 2 points.
Communication:

Keep players informed about how the point system works, emphasizing the importance of new player retention and participation.
Benefits of This System
Encourages Genuine Introductions: Players will be more motivated to bring in new players they believe will enjoy the game and continue participating.
Fosters Community: This approach can create a supportive environment where existing players help newcomers get acclimated to the league.
Incentivizes Long-term Engagement: By rewarding ongoing participation, you help create a stable player base, making the league more enjoyable for everyone.
Let me know if you'd like to refine this idea further or if you have any additional elements you want to incorporate!

Sure! Let’s recap and refine your point system for the Commander league based on your ideas and preferences. Here’s a structured overview:

Point System Overview
Basic Points
Points for Game Positions:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Participation Points:
1 point per round (for playing at least one game in that round).
3 points for introducing a new player who participates in at least one game.
Points for New Players
Initial Introduction:
Player A earns 1 point when Player B (the new player) participates in at least one game.
Retention Points:
At the end of the league, if Player B has continued playing (e.g., played a minimum number of games, like 3), Player A earns an additional 2 points.
Additional Considerations
Tracking Participation: Keep a log of all new players and their games to ensure accurate points allocation.
Communication: Clearly explain how the point system works to all players to encourage engagement and minimize confusion.
End-of-League Review: Consider doing a review at the end of the league to acknowledge contributions and track new player engagement.
Example Scenario
Player A introduces Player B.
Player B plays in 3 games during the league.
After Player B's first game, Player A receives 1 point.
At the end of the league, Player A earns an additional 2 points for Player B’s continued participation.
This system encourages players to not only introduce new participants but also foster an environment where newcomers feel welcomed and engaged throughout the league. Let me know if you’d like to adjust any part of this system or if you have more ideas to discuss!

i want to limit the number of points per week as i also have a physical board where i mark the points and i cant have "infinite" points. 12 might be low, now that i will introduce achievments.
Can you make some internal calculations and tell me the most appropriate number of points a player can do per week? 
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Based on the calculations, a player could potentially earn 42 points per week if all opportunities for points are maximized. Here's a breakdown of how that number was derived:

Points Breakdown Per Week
Game Positions:

From 3 games played, players can earn:
1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from positions for 3 games: (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) * 3 = 30 points.
Participation Points:

1 point for participating in a round: 1 point.
New Player Points:

If a player introduces up to 2 new players: 3 points each for a maximum of 6 points.
Achievement Points:

Assuming a player can earn up to 5 achievement points.
Total Possible Points:
30 (game positions) + 1 (participation) + 6 (new players) + 5 (achievements) = 42 points.
Recommendation
Given that 42 points is quite high, you might want to set a cap for weekly points to ensure the system remains manageable. Here are a few suggestions:

Cap at 30 Points: This allows for substantial rewards without overwhelming the board.
Cap at 24 Points: This keeps the points lower while still providing room for achievements and new player incentives.
Cap at 36 Points: A middle ground that balances the opportunities without being too high.
Let me know which cap you think works best or if you want to explore other options! ​​

the new player points  and the 1 point for playing in the round i can add to the total round points at the end of the round, so they can not be included in the point board
Dito pelo ChatGPT:

Memória atualizada
Got it! If you’re adding the new player points and participation points to the total round points at the end of each round, you can streamline the point system for the board. This way, only the points from game positions and achievements will be directly visible on the board.

Revised Points Breakdown for the Board
Game Positions (per week):

1st Place: 4 points
2nd Place: 3 points
3rd Place: 2 points
4th Place: 1 point
Total from positions for 3 games: (4 + 3 + 2 + 1) * 3 = 30 points.
Achievement Points:

Assume a player can earn up to 5 achievement points.
Total Possible Points on the Board (Without New Player and Participation Points):
30 (game positions) + 5 (achievements) = 35 points.
Points Allocation for Tracking:
New Player Points: Added at the end of the round based on the number of new players introduced.
Participation Points: Added at the end of the round as well.
Recommended Board Cap:
You could set the cap on the board to 35 points to account for game positions and achievements, keeping it manageable and competitive.
Does this revised approach work for you, or would you like to adjust the point system further?






Dito por si:
i think that 35 is too much
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
If 35 points feels too high, we can consider adjusting the system to set a more manageable cap while still allowing for meaningful rewards. Here are a few options:

Suggested Board Caps
Cap at 24 Points:

This would limit players to:
Game Positions: Up to 20 points (if a player wins all three games in a week).
Achievements: Up to 4 points.
Total: 20 + 4 = 24 points.
Cap at 30 Points:

A bit more flexible, allowing for:
Game Positions: Up to 24 points (winning all three games).
Achievements: Up to 6 points.
Total: 24 + 6 = 30 points.
Cap at 20 Points:

This is a more restrictive option:
Game Positions: Up to 15 points.
Achievements: Up to 5 points.
Total: 15 + 5 = 20 points.
Recommendation
Cap at 24 Points seems like a good balance, providing enough incentive while keeping competition healthy and manageable on your board.
This setup also encourages players to focus on achieving a variety of objectives without feeling overwhelmed by the total points available.
What do you think about these options?

Thanks for the clarification! Let's adjust the point system based on the correct scoring:

Points Breakdown
Game Positions (per week):

3 Games:
1st Place: 4 points (maximum for all three games = 12 points).
Achievement Points:

Assume players can earn up to 5 points through achievements.
Total Possible Points on the Board:
Game Positions: 12 points (if a player wins all three games).
Achievement Points: Up to 5 points.
Total on Board: 12 + 5 = 17 points.
Recommended Caps
Cap at 15 Points:

This would allow players to earn:
12 points from game positions (winning all games).
3 points from achievements.
Cap at 12 Points:

This would limit the points strictly to game positions (12 points) and exclude achievement points from the board.
Cap at 18 Points:

Allows for 12 points from game positions and 6 points from achievements.
Recommendation
Cap at 15 Points strikes a good balance, keeping competition engaging while ensuring players can't accumulate too many points too quickly.
This setup allows for room to reward achievements without overwhelming the board.
What do you think about this adjustment?

or could i just add the round achievment at the end of the round and not use the board, i could just count the week achievments
Dito pelo ChatGPT:
ChatGPT
Yes, that’s a great approach! By adding the round achievements at the end of the round and only using the board for weekly achievements, you can streamline the point system while still rewarding players effectively. Here’s how it could work:

Point Structure
Board Points (Weekly Achievements):

Game Positions:
Up to 12 points for winning all three games (4 points each).
Weekly Achievements:
Set a cap (e.g., 3 to 5 points) for achievements that can be awarded each week based on gameplay.
Round Achievements:

At the end of each round, tally up round achievements for each player. These points will not be visible on the board but will contribute to their overall standings.
You can have a more extensive list of achievements for rounds without limiting the point cap, as they won't affect the visible scores each week.
Total Points Calculation:
Visible on Board: Maximum of 12 points from game positions + weekly achievements (3 to 5 points).
Total Points: Track all round achievements separately to show the overall performance.
Benefits:
Keeps the weekly competition focused on immediate performance.
Allows for flexibility and encourages players to pursue a broader range of achievements without overwhelming the board.
Would you like to brainstorm what those weekly achievements could look like, or do you have any other aspects you want to explore?

what do you think about this cardmarket article:


Have you ever dealt 90 damage to a single player in a single turn, had twenty +1/+1 counters on a single creature, used a mass reanimation spell for just one creature, or died to your own Mana Crypt? These are just some of the minor achievements to unlock in Commander, a format where craziness abounds.


In-Game Gamification

water gun balloon game
Ever since achievements became a part of video games, players world-wide have had a way to track not just their progress, but also to claim certain rewards for doing this in style. Recently, fellow Dutchman Frank Karsten wrote an article about achievements to unlock in Theros Beyond Death Limited, and it got me thinking about creating an achievement system for Commander.

One of the great aspects of Commander is that it's a format of stories and experiences. The nature of the format allows for plays that you wouldn't really see in any other format. Often you get to create ridiculous situations that players will remember for a long time.

Bragging Rights
There is no need to treat the following as direct objectives in a Commander game. Rather it's a list of fun acts or lines that you made happen along way. Every item on this list gives you points, and you can choose to keep track of these points over the course of every Commander game you plan to play in the near future.

These achievements are not to be confused with the Commander League, a different way to play Commander that subtracts or rewards you with points for performing certain actions during a game. They are just to keep track of crazy things that happened in your playgroup.

Achievement Hunting
While I'm sure there are plenty of other achievements, these are the ones that I could think of and found interesting enough for you to try. Collect points and compare with your friends or playgroup. While I tried to keep the challenges as balanced as possible, some are hard (or impossible) to achieve with certain decks. That said, I wouldn't build decks specifically to unlock all of them. Rather keep playing with the decks that you already have, and once you feel like you're nearing one of these goals, go for it.

Did I miss any important achievements? What achievements would you come up with? Did you already manage to get some of these? Let me know in the comments, I look forward to reading your stories. As always, thanks for reading. Until next time!
